Build a complete full-stack AI-powered video voice dubbing platform that converts the audio of any video (URL or uploaded file) into any language supported by Google Translate. The system must be production-ready, modular, and scalable, with a single language backend (Node.js + Express) for easy online deployment. The platform should include a beautiful, modern, and responsive frontend (React + Vite + TailwindCSS) suitable for an expo demonstration.

Important:
- Use only **Google API keys** for Speech-to-Text (STT), Translation, and Text-to-Speech (TTS).
- Use **ElevenLabs API** only for premium Voice Cloning (toggleable via .env, enabled only on expo/premium mode).
- **Do not use OpenAI APIs.**

Features:

1. Frontend:
   - Responsive homepage with header: "AI Video Voice Language Converter".
   - Input box for video URL.
   - Upload button for local video files (MP4, MOV, MKV, WebM).
   - Auto-detect original language using Google STT (read-only display).
   - Dropdown for selecting target language (support all Google Translate languages, 200+).
   - "Convert Now" button, enabled only when a target language is selected.
   - Attractive, animated, expo-ready UI using TailwindCSS + Framer Motion.
   - Output page: video player with new dubbed voice, word-by-word subtitle highlighting, playback speed control, download buttons for video/audio/subtitles.
   - **Expo toggle system:** Features like subscription popup, signup/login buttons, and paid features should be **hidden during expo mode** and only enabled in online/public launch.
     - Implement `.env` variable `EXPO_MODE = true/false`.
     - If `EXPO_MODE = true`, hide subscription popup, signup/login, and paid prompts.
     - If `EXPO_MODE = false`, enable subscription popup, login/signup pages, and paid feature access.

2. Backend (Node.js + Express):
   - API routes: /api/fetch-video, /api/convert-audio, /api/voice-dub, /api/download.
   - Video download via URL (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook) or uploaded video.
   - Audio extraction using FFmpeg.
   - Automatic language detection using **Google STT**.
   - Speech-to-text transcription with word-level timestamps.
   - Translate transcript into any selected language using **Google Translate API**.
   - Generate new voice:
       - Default: **Google TTS**
       - Premium / Expo: **ElevenLabs voice cloning** (toggleable via .env)
   - Merge new voice into video, mute original audio, output MP4.
   - Generate subtitles (.SRT + .VTT) with perfect word timing for frontend highlighting.
   - Single-language backend for easier deployment (Node.js + Express).

3. Voice Dubbing Studio:
   - Mic recording and audio file upload.
   - Live transcription of user speech (editable) using Google STT.
   - Select output language.
   - Generate new voice using Google TTS or ElevenLabs voice cloning (premium mode).
   - Audio preview with playback speed control.
   - Download generated audio.

4. Subscription and Payment (toggleable):
   - Free demo: 30-second videos per day.
   - Paid plan: $10/month for full video processing (max 10 min).
   - Payment gateways: Razorpay, PayPal, Payoneer, or other Pakistan-friendly options.
   - Subscription popup and login/signup pages should be **hidden if EXPO_MODE = true** and shown only when EXPO_MODE = false.

5. Technical Requirements:
   - Full modular code structure:
       - /frontend
       - /backend
           - /routes
           - /controllers
           - /services
           - /utils
           - /ffmpeg-temp-files (auto-cleanup)
   - Environment variables for all API keys (.env file):
       - GOOGLE_API_KEY for STT, Translate, TTS
       - ELEVENLABS_API_KEY for voice cloning
       - EXPO_MODE = true/false
   - Async processing where possible for scalable performance.
   - Deployment-ready for Replit, Vercel, Render, or Railway.

6. Additional Features:
   - All system in a single backend language (Node.js) for easy deployment.
   - Auto-delete temporary video/audio files after processing.
   - Conversion history dashboard for users.
   - Caching and optimized processing queue.
   - Attractive, clean UI for expo day demonstration.
   - Support all languages listed in Google Translate (200+ languages).

7. Deliverables:
   - Complete frontend and backend source code.
   - Fully working APIs.
   - Video upload + URL processing.
   - Voice cloning integration (ElevenLabs, toggleable).
   - Multi-language support via Google APIs.
   - Word-by-word subtitles with frontend highlighting.
   - Downloadable video, audio, and subtitles.
   - Guides: README.md, API docs, deployment instructions.

Notes:
- Use environment variables for all API keys; do not hardcode.
- Code must be modular, clean, and production-ready.
- UI must be fully responsive and visually attractive for expo demonstration.
- Ensure the project is fully runnable on Replit without errors.
- Implement `EXPO_MODE` toggle to hide/show subscription, signup/login, and paid feature elements.
